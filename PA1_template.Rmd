## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
str(data)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calcualte the sum of steps for each day:
```{r, echo = TRUE}
stepsPerDay <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum, na.rm =TRUE)
```

Plot a histogram of this data:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
hist(stepsPerDay)
```

The mean of steps taken each day is
```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean(stepsPerDay)
```

And the median is
```{r, echo = TRUE}
median(stepsPerDay)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
